The Puli Bundle for Symfony Projects
====================================

There are two ways of using Puli with the `Symfony framework`_:

* New projects can be started based on the `Symfony Puli Edition`_.
* Existing projects can be extended with the `Puli Bundle`_.

Both ways are described in detail below.

Starting a Project from the Symfony Puli Edition
------------------------------------------------

A new project can be started based on the Symfony Puli Edition with `Composer`_.
`Install Composer`_ and enter the following command in a terminal:

.. code-block:: text

    $ composer create-project puli/symfony-puli-edition /path/to/project "~2.5@dev"

.. tip::

    To download the vendor files faster, add the ``--prefer-dist`` option at the
    end of any Composer command.

Composer will create a new project based on the Symfony Puli Edition in
`/path/to/project` with Symfony 2.5.

Read the `Installing and Configuring Symfony`_ to learn more about installing
Symfony distributions.

Installing the Puli Bundle
--------------------------

If you cannot or don't want to start off the Symfony Puli Edition, you need to
install the Puli Bundle with `Composer`_. `Install Composer`_ and enter the
following command in a terminal:

.. code-block:: text

    $ composer require "puli/symfony-bundle:~1.0"

.. note::

    Since puli is in beta phase, it requires that you allow it to install other
    dependencies that are also in beta. The easiest way is to set "minimum-stability"
    setting to "beta" in composer.json

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            ...,
            "minimum-stability": "beta"
        }

    However, this may have consequences on other dependencies. If this happens, an
    alternative is to explicitly require all of the puli packages as beta versions
    in composer.json.


This will download the bundle to your project.

When this command completes, run ``composer install`` to initialize the
Composer plugin for Puli:

.. code-block:: text

    $ composer install

Now, enable the bundle by modifying ``AppKernel``:

.. code-block:: php

    // app/AppKernel.php

    // ...
    class AppKernel extends Kernel
    {
        // ...

        public function registerBundles()
        {
            $bundles = array(
                // ...,
                new Puli\SymfonyBundle\PuliBundle(),
            );

            // ...
        }
    }

The bundle is now installed in your project.

Bundle Usage
------------

Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the bundle, you can load configuration files by Puli paths. This is mostly
needed when loading bundle routes in routing.yml or routing_dev.yml:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # routing_dev.yml
    _wdt:
        resource: /symfony/web-profiler-bundle/config/routing/wdt.xml
        prefix:   /_wdt

This entry will load all routes found under the Puli path
``/symfony/web-profiler-bundle/config/routing/wdt.xml``. Usually, the first two
directories of a Puli path correspond to the name of a Composer package. In this
example, the file ``config/routing/wdt.xml`` is loaded from the ``Resources``
directory in the package "symfony/web-profiler".

Read :doc:`symfony-bridge` if you want to learn more about using Puli with
Symfony configuration files.

Twig Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the bundle, it is possible to refer to Twig templates by Puli paths. This
is typically done in the controller when rendering a template:

.. code-block:: php

    // DemoController.php

    // ...
    class DemoController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * @Route("/hello/{name}", name="_demo_hello")
         */
        public function helloAction($name)
        {
            return $this->render('/acme/demo-bundle/views/demo/hello.html.twig', array(
                'name' => $name,
            ));
        }

        // ...
    }

In this example, the template at the Puli path
``/acme/demo-bundle/views/demo/hello.html.twig`` is rendered.

Within Twig templates, you can also refer to other templates by Puli paths:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# views/demo/hello.html.twig #}

    {% extends "/acme/demo-bundle/views/layout.html.twig" %}

    ...

This will let the ``hello.html.twig`` template extend the template
``/acme/demo-bundle/views/layout.html.twig``. Instead of passing the absolute
Puli path, it is usually more comfortable to pass relative paths instead:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# views/demo/hello.html.twig #}

    {% extends "../layout.html.twig" %}

    ...
